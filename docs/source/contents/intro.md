Bootstrap Italia
----------------

The [Bootstrap Italia library](https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/)
is the simplest and safest way to build modern,
inclusive and easy to maintain web interfaces.

Completely open-source, built on the foundations of
[Bootstrap 4.5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/),
of which it inherits all the features, components, grids and utility classes,
customizing them according to the Design Guidelines for
[Italian Public Administration websites](https://docs.italia.it/italia/designers-italia/design-linee-guida-docs/),
Bootstrap Italia uses patterns and components defined in the
[Designers Italia UI Kit](https://designers.italia.it/kit/ui-kit/)
and transforms them into ready-to-use code!


Bootstrap Italia Django theme
-----------------------------

This library for the Django Python framework provides the default
template scheme, suitably divided into blocks to be overloaded,
in order to provide your project with a graphical interface
that respects the design guidelines for web services of
the Italian Public administration.
